# Pandas_Challenge_2

- This is my Homework 4: PyCitySchools. 

- For this assingment I created a District Summary, a School Summary, a chart for Top Performing Schools By % Overall Passing, a chart for Bottom Performing Schools by % Overall Passing, Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, and Scores by School Type.

    "1. Charter schools have higher passing rates than district schools. When we sorted our School Summary table from the school with the highest overall passing rate to the lowest, the top 5 schools were Charter. When we sorted the schools from the lowest overall passing rate to the higest, the top 5 schools were District. We can also see this in our Scores by School Type table. The scores for charter schools were higher in every category. \n",
    "2. There is an inverse relationship between the budget of the school and student success; more money does not mean better results. You can see this by looking at the \"Per Student Budget\" column in the tables that sorted the School Summary table by the highest overall passing percentage and the lowest overall passing percentange. You can also see this in the Scores by School Spending table."
